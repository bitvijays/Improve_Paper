# Improve_Paper
Check your paper against certain keywords to make it more concise as suggested in [Writing for Computer Science](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781447166382) book.

The python script mainly checks for pre-defined keywords in the [Words Check](https://github.com/bitvijays/Improve_Paper/tree/main/words_check) folder and highlight them with specfic color. 

```
CHECKLIST_WORDS = ["voice", "repeatation", "qualifiers", "choice_of_words", "Obfuscation_Straw_Men"]
CHECKLIST_COLORS = [MAGENTA, CYAN, GOLD, GREEN, RED]
```
